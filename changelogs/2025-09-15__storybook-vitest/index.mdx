![Storybook Vitest Support](/assets/changelogs/storybook-vitest/storybook-vitest.jpg)

Argos now supports the **Storybook Vitest addon**, making it simple to add visual tests right inside your stories.

- **Run in CI**: Argos captures screenshots during your CI runs for consistent, reproducible results.
- **Use the `play` function**: Take screenshots at any point in your `play` function to validate intermediate states.
- **Unlimited execution time**: Wait for interactions, async flows, or animations to finish before the screenshot is taken.

With this integration, you can validate not only the static render of your components but their full interactive behavior.
