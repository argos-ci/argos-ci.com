Introducing Storybook Story Modes in [Argos Storybook plugin](https://argos-ci.com/docs/quickstart/storybook). With the latest release, you can define and apply multiple Storybook globals (e.g., themes, viewports, locales) as “modes,” generating separate snapshots for each mode automatically.

- **Multi-Config Testing**: Capture different looks (dark/light, mobile/desktop, etc.) for each story without duplicating code.
- **Easy Configuration**: Define modes in .storybook/modes.js (or .ts) and apply them globally, component-wide, or story-by-story.
- **Simple Parameter Usage**: Configure Argos via `parameters.argos`. We also honor `parameters.chromatic` if you’re migrating from Chromatic.
- **Isolated Baselines**: Each mode maintains its own baseline and approval workflow, making changes easy to track and compare.

Upgrade to the latest version of [`@argos-ci/storybook`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@argos-ci/storybook) to start testing your Storybook stories across every relevant configuration with fewer manual steps. Read the complete guide in [story modes documentation](https://argos-ci.com/docs/storybook-story-modes).
