![Build status filters](/assets/changelogs/build-filters/build-status-filters.jpg)

Weâ€™ve made it easier to search through your build history by allowing you to filter builds by both **status** and **type**. With these filters, you can instantly hone in on the exact builds you need, no more scrolling through a massive list.

- **Filter by Type:** Show only "Check", "Orphan" or "Auto-approved" builds to focus on the ones you need.
- **Filter by Status:** Narrow down builds using statuses such as "Approved", "Rejected", "No changes" or "Changes detected".

Explore the new filters in your Builds tab today.
