![Retried failures in Argos](/assets/changelogs/retried-failures/retried-failures.jpg)

Recognizing the critical importance of stability in continuous integration, Argos has introduced a dedicated section for handling retried test failures. This update is in direct response to your valuable feedback, aimed at minimizing disruptions and maximizing team productivity.

With this enhancement, you can still review the screenshots of test retries without cluttering your workspace with test failures that have finally passed.

Start experiencing the benefits of this refined approach today, and let us know your thoughts as we continue to refine and evolve Argos.
