![Argos running on a Playwright test suite with some skipped builds](/assets/changelogs/subset-builds/subset-builds.jpg)

**Subset builds** let you run Argos on a partial test suite while keeping feedback focused on what actually ran. When a build is marked as subset, Argos ignores removed screenshots and only reports **changed** and **added** screenshots from the tests that executed.

- **Fast feature validation**: Skip the full E2E suite on branches without losing visual insight.
- **No false removals**: Missing screenshots from skipped tests won’t be flagged.
- **Baseline safe**: Full runs on the main branch still power baseline builds.
