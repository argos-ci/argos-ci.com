Argos now lets you select a default role for all team contributors in a given project. Instead of assigning roles one-by-one, you can define a single default role: viewer, reviewer, or admin. This avoid repetitive manual assignments and ensures that every contributor has the correct level of access.

- **Centralized control**: Choose a default role to apply to every contributor in a project, cutting down on repetitive manual assignments.
- **Flexible access**: Continue customizing individual contributor roles as needed, ensuring that you maintain control and clarity for your entire team.
- **Simplified management**: Make onboarding new contributors easier by ensuring theyâ€™re immediately assigned a baseline level of permissions.

Check out [the documentation](https://argos-ci.com/docs/team-members-and-roles#default-project-roles) for more details on setting default roles and refining access levels.
