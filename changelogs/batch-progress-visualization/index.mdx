Argos now enriches your experience on the build page by displaying the progression of batches. This feature aims to provide immediate insights into the status of your builds, specifically highlighting if a build is pending due to a batch failure. It's designed to streamline your debugging process, ensuring you can quickly identify and address issues.

Furthermore, we've introduced detailed explanations for parallel builds marked as expired. This addition is geared towards offering clarity on your build's status, enhancing your ability to troubleshoot effectively.
