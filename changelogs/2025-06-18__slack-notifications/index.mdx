![Slack notification example from Argos](/assets/changelogs/slack-notifications/slack-notification.png)

Argos now supports Slack notifications! Your team gets notified when a build is completed or reviewed, so everyone stays in the loop.

- **Automations**: Trigger notifications on build completion or review.
- **Flexible Rules**: Define exactly when and how notifications are sent.
- **Targeted Delivery**: Choose which Slack channels receive the updates.

Read the full setup guide in our [Slack notifications documentation](https://argos-ci.com/docs/notifications/slack).
