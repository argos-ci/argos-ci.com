Argos now supports [**ARIA Snapshots**](https://playwright.dev/docs/aria-snapshots) with the Playwright SDK, giving you a structured view of your page’s accessibility tree directly in your visual testing workflow.

- **Easily review text changes**: You can now easily spot changes in text content.
- **Accessibility insights**: Capture the ARIA representation of your pages to detect accessibility regressions over time.
- **Combined or standalone**: Use `argosScreenshot` with `ariaSnapshot: true` to capture both visuals and ARIA trees, or call `argosAriaSnapshot` for ARIA-only tests.

This feature helps teams combine **visual** and **accessibility** testing in one unified workflow, improving overall UI quality and inclusiveness.
