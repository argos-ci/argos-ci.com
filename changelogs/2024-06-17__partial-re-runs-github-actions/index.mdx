We finally introduce support for partial re-runs in GitHub Actions, a significant enhancement to streamline your CI/CD processes with Argos.

- **Time savings:** No more waiting for entire workflows to complete. Re-run only the steps that failed or need updating.
- **Cost efficiency:** Reduce computational costs by avoiding unnecessary re-execution of successful steps.
- **Ecology concern:** Lower energy consumption by minimizing redundant processing, contributing to a greener environment.

To benefit from this feature, update your SDK. If you don't use Playwright, set the [`ARGOS_PARALLEL_INDEX`](https://argos-ci.com/docs/parallel-testing) environment variable in your GitHub Actions workflow.
