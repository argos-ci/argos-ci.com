To wrap up the year on a high note, we’re introducing Team Analytics, a new dashboard that helps you track and understand your visual testing activity at a glance. Monitor builds, screenshots, and detailed usage to keep your team running efficiently.

### Key Features

- **Build & Screenshot Trends:** Compare how each project contributes to the total number of builds and screenshots, all in one place.
- **Usage by period:** Quickly review activity to spot trends and see how your test volume evolves over time.
- **Screenshots by Project:** Get a breakdown of each project’s screenshot usage, making it easy to allocate resources.
- **Screenshots by Build:** Dive deeper into each build’s screenshot count for a fine-grained analysis of your tests.

This feature is included in all plans. Head to your Analytics tab and see your team’s metrics in action.
