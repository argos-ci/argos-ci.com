The new **Tests dashboard** gives you a project-wide view of all tests ranked by flakiness, so you can quickly spot the most unstable areas and focus your efforts where they matter most. It’s another step in Argos’ complete flaky test management, helping teams stay ahead of noisy or unreliable tests.

- **Flakiness-first sorting**: Tests are ordered by instability so the biggest problems rise to the top.
- **Project-wide coverage**: See every test in one place to understand overall health at a glance.
- **Faster prioritization**: Focus on the tests most likely to cause noise in reviews and builds.
