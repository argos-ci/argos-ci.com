![Ignore changes](/assets/changelogs/ignore-changes/ignore-changes.jpg)

You can now **ignore a set of changes** in your tests. When you ignore a change, Argos will not notify you if this specific change occurs again in the future. This is useful for multiple scenarios, such as:

- **Flaky Elements**: If a UI element is unstable, displayed inconsistently, or has rendering issues, you can ignore its changes to avoid unnecessary noise in your visual tests.
- **Image Rendering Issues**: If an image is rendered differently across environments or devices, ignoring its changes helps maintain focus on more critical visual regressions.

By ignoring a specific set of changes rather than an entire region, you ensure that real regressions can still be detected in the future. In contrast, ignoring a region suppresses all future notifications for that area, even if meaningful changes occur.

Combined with our [Flaky Test Detection](https://argos-ci.com/changelog/2025-06-26-flaky-test-detection), this feature provides a powerful way to manage visual test noise. Especially with our "Ocurrences" stats that gives you the exact number of times a change has been seen.

This feature is now available to all users. Learn how to use it in the [docs](https://argos-ci.com/docs/flaky-test-detection).
