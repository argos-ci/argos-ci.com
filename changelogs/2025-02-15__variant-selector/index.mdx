Introduing screenshot diff variants, allowing you to view and select different variations of a screenshot diff based on viewport size or browser.

- **Multi-viewport & multi-browser comparison**: Quickly switch between different versions of a screenshot taken on various browsers and viewports.
- **Faster debugging**: Easily spot inconsistencies across different environments without switching context.
- **Better accuracy**: Ensure that visual regressions are correctly assessed across all targeted configurations.

This feature helps teams catch cross-browser and responsive issues faster. You can access screenshot diff variants directly from the diff viewer when inspecting a visual change.
