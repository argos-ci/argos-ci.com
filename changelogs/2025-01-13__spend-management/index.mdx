Introducing Spend Management, a feature designed to help you monitor and control your team’s visual testing expenses effectively.

- **Customizable Spend Limits**: Set specific spending thresholds per billing cycle to manage your budget proactively.
- **Alert Notifications**: Receive email alerts at 50%, 75%, and 100% of your set spend amount, keeping you informed of your usage.
- **Automated Project Pausing**: Enable automatic pausing of all projects when your spending limit is reached, preventing unexpected overages.

Spend Management is available on Pro and Enterprise plans (usage-based). To get started, navigate to your team’s Settings tab and configure your spending preferences.

For detailed instructions, refer to our [Spend Management documentation](/docs/spend-management).
