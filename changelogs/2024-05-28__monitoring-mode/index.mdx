We have added a new feature: **Monitoring Mode**. This mode helps you track visual changes over time or before a release, providing additional assurance for your projects.

- **Periodic Visual Checks**: Set up Monitoring Mode to run visual tests periodically (e.g., daily or weekly) on a specific branch. This ensures any unexpected visual changes are detected early.
- **Pre-release Validation**: Use Monitoring Mode to run visual checks on your release branch, comparing the current state with the last approved build to ensure everything looks as expected before the final deployment.
- **Post-deployment Monitoring**: Configure Monitoring Mode to run after each deployment to staging or production environments to catch any discrepancies caused by environmental differences.
- **Third-party Integrations**: Regularly check the visual integration points of third-party services or widgets to ensure they remain consistent and do not disrupt the user experience.

For detailed instructions on how to use Monitoring Mode, please refer to [our documentation](https://argos-ci.com/docs/monitoring-mode).
