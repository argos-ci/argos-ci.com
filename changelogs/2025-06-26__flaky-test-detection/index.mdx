Spot unstable tests right in your build review: Argos now adds a flaky indicator next to each change so you know if a test is flaky before you approve

- **Flaky Indicator**: A badge on each change flags tests with instability so you can act confidently
- **Test Page**: Click through to a dedicated page showing every change, stability over time and a calculated flaky score
- **Quick Decisions**: Use stability history and score to decide if you can safely approve or need a fix
- **Future Controls**: Weâ€™ll layer on tools to ignore irrelevant noise and better manage flaky tests
