## Company Overview

[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) is an open-source JavaScript library that allows users to generate diagrams and flowcharts from text in a markdown-like syntax. It’s widely adopted by developers, technical writers, and project managers to create and manage complex visual content easily. As the demand for accurate and dynamic diagram generation grows, ensuring the visual stability of these diagrams becomes paramount.

## The Challenge

Mermaid's users rely on the tool to generate intricate and precise diagrams. Any visual regression in the rendering process could lead to confusion or miscommunication, especially when these diagrams are used in technical documentation or project planning. Even minor shifts in diagram presentation can have a significant impact on usability and user experience.

The team at Mermaid needed a solution to **automatically detect any visual regression** during the development process. With an ever-expanding user base and continuous development, they sought a reliable visual testing tool that could scale with their growing needs, ensuring every new feature or update maintains the integrity of their diagram rendering.

## The Solution: Argos

Mermaid integrated [Argos](https://argos-ci.com/) into their CI pipeline to prevent visual regressions in their diagram rendering. Argos is an open-source visual testing tool that compares screenshots of web pages or components across different builds and flags any discrepancies. By integrating Argos, Mermaid was able to catch unintended changes in the visuals of their diagrams early in the development cycle.

## Why Mermaid Chose Argos

- **Automated Visual Regression Testing:** Argos automatically detects even the smallest discrepancies in diagram rendering, allowing Mermaid to catch issues before they reach production.
- **Seamless CI Integration:** Argos integrates effortlessly with Mermaid’s existing CI pipeline, enabling their team to maintain continuous testing without adding complexity to their workflow.
- **Open-Source Flexibility:** Like Mermaid, Argos is open-source, which aligns with Mermaid’s philosophy and allows for customization as needed.

## Results

Since implementing Argos, Mermaid has seen a **significant reduction in visual regression bugs** in their diagram rendering. The team now has complete confidence that any updates or new features will not inadvertently disrupt the visual accuracy of the diagrams their users rely on.
