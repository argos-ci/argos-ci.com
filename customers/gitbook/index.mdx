## The Challenge

GitBook, a leading documentation platform trusted by teams and developers worldwide, serves millions of users daily through its robust editor and published documentation. With the platform being such a critical tool for sharing knowledge and building communities, maintaining the visual integrity of both the editor interface and the published documents is paramount.

As GitBook scaled, they faced the challenge of ensuring that new updates to their app wouldn’t inadvertently introduce visual regressions. Any small misalignment or UI change could disrupt the experience of millions of readers and creators. Given the sheer volume of users relying on GitBook to create and consume content seamlessly, a reliable solution was needed to catch potential issues before they reached production.

## The Solution

To address this challenge, GitBook implemented **Argos**, an open-source visual testing tool designed to catch visual regressions before they cause disruption. With Argos seamlessly integrated into their CI/CD pipeline, GitBook now has full confidence in their ability to catch any visual changes introduced by updates.

From subtle UI tweaks in the editor to larger layout adjustments in the published documentation, Argos ensures that every change is visually vetted. This has been especially crucial for GitBook’s commitment to delivering an uninterrupted and flawless user experience to both creators and readers.
