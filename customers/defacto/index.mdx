## Overview

[Defacto](https://getdefacto.com/) is a fast-growing French fintech, providing an AI-powered B2B lending platform to over 10,000 SMEs across Europe. By partnering with platforms like Qonto and Malt, Defacto offers fast, reliable, and scalable financing for businesses of all sizes.

## Challenge

Defacto set out to rebuild their entire web application to enhance the user experience and introduce new functionality. They needed a way to ensure high-quality output without sacrificing development speed—a key concern for a growing business like theirs.

Their main challenges included:

- **Regression protection**: Ensuring that new pages and features didn’t break existing ones.
- **Design system stability**: Keeping visual consistency across components as the design system evolved.
- **Multi-language support**: Maintaining consistent visuals across different language versions of the site.
- **White-label theming**: Ensuring integrity across multiple branded themes.
- **Development speed**: Maintaining velocity without compromising quality.

## Solution: Argos

Defacto integrated [Argos](https://argos-ci.com/) into their CI/CD pipeline to automate visual regression testing. Argos offered a lightweight solution that allowed the team to instantly detect visual changes across pages, themes, and languages. This provided:

- **Automatic regression detection**: Every new change was compared against existing snapshots, ensuring nothing broke unintentionally.
- **Design system resilience**: Argos tested components across the entire system, protecting UI consistency.
- **Multi-language and theming checks**: Argos validated that the site performed visually, regardless of language or white-label themes.
- **Fast feedback loop**: With Argos embedded in the CI pipeline, developers received near-instant feedback, allowing quick iteration and safe deployment of new features.

## Results

Thanks to Argos, Defacto was able to:

- **Launch the new web app faster** than initially planned, with confidence that visual bugs would be caught before they reached production.
- **Maintain long-term design system integrity**, ensuring that new developers onboarding the project don’t inadvertently cause regressions.
- **Prevent visual regressions in white-label theming** and multi-language support, which would have been cumbersome to manage manually.
- **Safeguard future development velocity** by having an automated solution in place that scales with their growing team.

## Conclusion

Argos transformed the way Defacto approached testing. By automating regression checks and providing real-time insights, the team was able to focus on delivering new features quickly and confidently. As Defacto continues to scale, Argos remains a crucial part of their development workflow, ensuring the visual quality and consistency their users expect.
