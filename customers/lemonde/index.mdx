## Ensuring a Smooth Editorial Workflow with Argos

Sirius is the backbone of the group’s content operations. It is built around a wide range of advanced editors, including complex block structures, home page management, and article planning tools. Visual regressions in these areas can break critical workflows and directly affect journalists’ ability to publish.

To maintain a high level of reliability and ensure updates do not introduce regressions, Le Monde uses Argos for visual testing. Argos detects visual changes in Sirius early, allowing the team to fix issues before they reach production and disrupt editorial work.

      Thanks to Argos, we can confidently deploy updates to Sirius without
      worrying about unexpected issues disrupting our editorial workflows.

Beyond detection, the Sirius team relies heavily on screenshot failures to debug issues. When a test fails, the visual diff provides immediate context about what changed and where, making it much faster to understand the root cause. This visual feedback often removes the need for lengthy reproductions or manual checks and speeds up fixes during development.

## Avoiding Costly Delays

For Le Monde, a delay in publication can have serious consequences and may cost the group millions of euros. At this scale, CMS reliability is both a technical and a financial concern.

Argos helps prevent regressions that could lead to these delays by ensuring every update is visually validated. The development team can ship new features and fixes with confidence, knowing that critical editorial flows will remain intact.
