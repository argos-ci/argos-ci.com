## The Challenge

Finviz builds a stock research platform where **visual accuracy is critical**. Their product relies heavily on high-definition charts that encode financial data directly into pixels. A single visual difference can signal a real functional regression in the rendering or data pipeline.

Unlike traditional UI components, charts cannot be validated with simple assertions. A shifted line, a missing candle, or a slightly incorrect scale may indicate incorrect calculations or broken rendering logic.

Finviz already relied on **Playwright for end-to-end testing**, but functional E2E tests alone were not enough. They needed **visual testing** to ensure that what users actually see on screen remains correct across changes, devices, and resolutions.

Manual review did not scale, especially with responsive layouts and frequent iterations on charting logic.

## The Solution

Finviz adopted **Argos** to add **visual regression testing** on top of their existing Playwright E2E suite.

During E2E runs, Playwright captures screenshots from real user scenarios. These screenshots are uploaded to Argos, where they are compared against stable visual baselines. Any pixel-level difference is surfaced directly in CI before the pull request can be merged.

The team runs visual testing across **multiple responsive breakpoints**, including desktop and mobile views, ensuring consistent rendering regardless of screen size.

Thanks to Argos support for **high-definition screenshots** and its **smart zooming algorithm**, engineers can inspect differences at the exact level where regressions occur, without losing context.

Visual feedback is posted directly on pull requests, making visual testing a first-class part of the review process.

## Visual Testing as Functional Validation

For Finviz, visual testing is not limited to catching UI styling issues. A visual difference on a chart often reflects a **functional regression**.

This approach allows the team to validate not only that a flow works, but that the **rendered financial data is correct** across environments.

## Built for Responsive Visual Testing at Scale

Finviz runs visual testing across a wide range of chart configurations, datasets, and responsive layouts. Despite the size and density of screenshots, Argos builds remain fast and deterministic.

The smart zooming feature allows reviewers to immediately focus on meaningful changes, whether they appear in a dense desktop chart or a constrained mobile view.

## The Results

With Argos integrated into their Playwright-based CI pipeline, Finviz has raised the bar on visual quality and reliability.

The team now benefits from:

- Pixel-level visual testing of high-definition financial charts
- Early detection of functional regressions through visual diffs
- Confident validation of responsive rendering on desktop and mobile
- Automatic visual protection before pull requests are merged

Argos enables Finviz to ship charting changes faster, while preserving the accuracy and trust users expect from a financial research platform.

## Looking Ahead

As Finviz continues to expand its analytical tools and visual complexity, Argos remains a core part of their visual testing strategy.

By combining Playwright E2E tests with deterministic visual regression testing, Finviz ensures that every release preserves the precision and clarity that traders and investors rely on every day.
