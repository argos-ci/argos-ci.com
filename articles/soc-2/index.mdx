We're excited to announce that Argos has successfully completed a SOC 2 Type II audit to further demonstrate our commitment to security.

<MainImage />

Achieving SOC 2 Type II compliance is a significant milestone for us, as it demonstrates our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security, privacy, and reliability for our customers.

## What is SOC 2?

[System and Organization Control (SOC) 2](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2) is a compliance framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) that focuses on how well an organization's infrastructure remains secure and protects customer data.

A SOC 2 Type II report assesses whether an organization's systems meet the relevant trust services categories, as well as the effectiveness and reliability of those controls over a specified period of time.

## Argos journey to SOC 2 Type II certification

SOC 2 Type II was a deep, months-long audit of our systems and internal practices. With [Prescient Assurance LLC](https://prescientsecurity.com/), we underwent a rigorous independent review that validated the strength of our controls and our team's commitment to protecting user data.
