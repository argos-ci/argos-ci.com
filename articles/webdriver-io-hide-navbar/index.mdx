Mobile app development is a realm where bugs can remain for months, dependent on users to update their apps. With Argos's latest WebDriverIO update, we introduce Navbar Masking - a feature crafted to enhance the precision of visual testing in mobile apps, ensuring a flawless user experience every time.

## Why Navbar Masking?

Mobile navbars, displaying ever-changing elements like time and notifications, are notorious for causing visual inconsistencies. Leveraging Sharp's image processing capabilities, Argos's Navbar Masking lets you specify areas in your screenshots to be masked. This ensures dynamic elements in the navbar don't skew your visual regression results.

```js
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/webdriverio";
import { browser } from "@wdio/globals";

describe("Integration test with visual testing", () => {
  it("covers homepage", async () => {
    await browser.url("http://localhost:3000");
    await argosScreenshot(browser, "homepage", {
      mask: [{ x: 0, y: 0, width: 1170, height: 120 }],
