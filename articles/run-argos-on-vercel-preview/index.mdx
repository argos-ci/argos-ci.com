Argos now offers a smooth integration with Vercel Preview for visual testing, enabling users to effectively identify visual regressions in an environment that closely simulates production. This guide provides a detailed walkthrough on configuring Argos on Vercel Preview through GitHub Actions, including shared source code for straightforward replication.

## The Benefits of Visual Testing with Vercel Preview

- **Cost Efficiency in CI**: Eliminate the need for duplicate application builds, saving time and resources.

- **Enhanced Test Reliability**: Run visual tests in an environment that mirrors production, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

**Important Note:** This strategy is most effective for idempotent tests that can be executed repeatedly without altering the environment. Tests involving significant modifications, like user deletions, might not be compatible.

## Prerequisites

1. Setup [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) on your project. For a Next.js application, follow [this guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/testing/playwright).
2. Deploy your project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Setup Argos in my project

### 1. Import your project in Argos

[Sign up to Argos](https://app.argos-ci.com/signup) and import your project. Save the `ARGOS_TOKEN` for later.

### 2. Install Argos Playwright SDK

```sh
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/playwright
```

### 3. Update your Playwright config

Argos integrates with Playwright using a custom reporter. To upload your screenshots to Argos when Playwright tests run, add `@argos-ci/playwright/reporter` in your `playwright.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  // ... other configuration

  reporter: [
    // Use "dot" reporter on CI, "list" otherwise (Playwright default).
    process.env.CI ? ["dot"] : ["list"],
    // Add Argos reporter.
    [
      "@argos-ci/playwright/reporter",
      {
        // Upload to Argos on CI only.
        uploadToArgos: !!process.env.CI,

        // Set your Argos token.
        token: "<YOUR-ARGOS-TOKEN>",
      },
    ],
  ],

  use: {
    // On CI, we will set `BASE_URL` from Vercel preview URL
    baseURL: process.env.CI ? process.env.BASE_URL : "http://localhost:3000",
  },

  extraHTTPHeaders: {
    // Hide Vercel Toolbar in tests
    "x-vercel-skip-toolbar": "0",
  },
});
```

### 4. Take screenshots of your app

The [Screenshot pages script](https://argos-ci.com/docs/screenshot-pages-script) from Argos's documentation was utilized for capturing the application's homepage, offering flexibility to include additional pages in the future.

```ts
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/playwright";
import { test } from "@playwright/test";

const pages = [
  { name: "homepage", path: "/" },
  // Add other pages if needed
];

for (const { name, path } of pages) {
  test(`run Argos on ${name} (${path})`, async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto(path);
    await argosScreenshot(page, name);
  });
}
```

## Run Argos on Vercel Preview

To initiate tests on Vercel Preview, the workflow will respond to the `deployment_status` event, triggering the test workflow upon a Vercel deployment notification.

**Note:** Alternative approaches, such as the [Await for Vercel Deployment](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/await-for-vercel-deployment) action, can be utilized to retrieve the Vercel deployment URL for testing purposes.

Below is an example of a workflow file designed to execute tests on a Vercel deployment:

```yml
# .github/workflows/test-preview.yml
name: Playwright + Argos Tests
on:
  # Trigger on deployment event
  deployment_status:
jobs:
  test:
    # Run tests only if the deployment is successful
    if: github.event_name == 'deployment_status' && github.event.deployment_status.state == 'success'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        uses: docker://mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.42.1-jammy
        run: npm exec -- playwright test
        env:
          # Set the GITHUB_TOKEN, Argos will use it to retrieve
          # informations about your deployment
          # Read more about GITHUB_TOKEN here: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Set `BASE_URL` with Vercel Preview URL
          BASE_URL: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.environment_url }}
          # If the test runs on the production deployment, use "main" as branch
          # Here's "main" must be the reference branch set up in Argos
          ARGOS_BRANCH: ${{ github.event.deployment_status.environment == 'Production' && 'main' || '' }}
```

For a comprehensive explanation of each step involved, refer to the [Argos Preview Deployment Guide](https://argos-ci.com/docs/run-on-preview-deployment).

Upon completion, you will receive status checks on GitHub:

## Conclusion

Vercel Preview and Argos form a powerful duo in web development. Vercel Preview allows hands-on, manual verification of your web applications in real environments. Argos leverage automated visual regression testing, catching any discrepancies across devices and browsers. This combination, they make a great team, giving developers the peace of mind that their sites are both functionally robust and beautifully across all screens.
