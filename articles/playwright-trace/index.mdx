**Ever wished you could replay a test that failed in your CI?** That's where Playwright Traces come in! This guide shows how it seamlessly fits into your CI workflow, making bug-hunting easier and more effective.

## Debugging Trace in Action

Let's jump right into a practical scenario. In the video below, I'll show how to use the Playwright Trace Viewer to inspect a failed test, identify the issue, and apply a fix.

In this video, I focus on resolving a complex locator issue. Besides this, Playwright Trace Viewer offers an extensive array of features for pinpointing test failures, including network logs, and console messages or step-by-step snapshots, not covered here.

## Integrating with Your CI

### 1. Record Traces when a Test Fails

To automatically record traces on your CI, simply update your Playwright config file with this option:

```ts
use: {
  trace: 'on-first-retry',
}
```

Now, whenever a test fails, a trace file is generated, ready for download or online viewing with a third-party reporter.

### 2. Open Trace Files

To open a Trace file, either upload it to [trace.playwright.dev](https://trace.playwright.dev) or run the command:

```sh
npx playwright show-trace <TRACE_FILE_PATH>.zip
```

### 3. Third-Party Reporting with Argos

To enhance your workflow, you can integrate your CI with [Argos](https://argos-ci.com) for direct access to Playwright Traces online. This seamless connection eliminates the need to download trace files, offering a more streamlined approach.

Check out the [Argos Playwright setup guide](https://argos-ci.com/docs/quickstart/playwright) for easy integration steps.
