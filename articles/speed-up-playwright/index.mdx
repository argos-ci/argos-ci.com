Playwright is an incredible tool for writing E2E tests on CI, but setup time can drag down your productivity. Imagine cutting that time in half! In this article, we‚Äôll dive into game-changing techniques to double the speed of your Playwright tests, including Docker, caching, and parallel execution. Let's supercharge your CI pipeline!

## Use Playwright Docker image

The quickest way to run tests on CI is by using the [official Playwright Docker image](https://playwright.dev/docs/docker). This image comes with all browsers and their dependencies pre-installed, saving you precious time on setup.

Here's how to run a step directly in a Docker container with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml
name: Playwright tests

jobs:
  playwright-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Other steps...

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        uses: docker://mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.44.0-jammy
        with:
          args: npm exec -- playwright test
```

### Fix Firefox permissions issue

For Firefox, you might encounter a permission error. To fix this, run tests with `HOME=/root`:

```yaml
- name: Run Playwright tests
  uses: docker://mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.44.0-jammy
  with:
    # Fix for Firefox, HOME=/root is required to avoid permission issues
    # https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/6500
    args: env HOME=/root npm exec -- playwright test
```

### Communicating with service containers

When running jobs in a container, GitHub uses Docker's networks to connect service containers. This means you can't use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` to access these services. Instead, use the service's name defined in your workflow. For example, replace `localhost` with the name of your service.

Here's an example of how to connect to a PostgreSQL database:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml
name: Playwright tests

jobs:
  playwright-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:13-alpine
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
        env:
          POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD: trust

    steps:
      # Other steps...

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        uses: docker://mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.44.0-jammy
        with:
          args: npm exec -- playwright test
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres@postgres/test
```

Containers are isolated from the GitHub Actions worker. If your server needs to access multiple services, achieving communication in a Docker container can be challenging. In such cases, run Playwright directly on the GitHub Action runner.

## Optimize Playwright installation

Running tests in Playwright requires installing browsers and their dependencies. Playwright provides two commands for this:

- `playwright install [browsers...]`: Installs specified browsers (Chromium, Firefox, etc.).
- `playwright install-deps [browsers...]` Installs necessary libraries.

### Install only specific browsers

To speed up installation, install only the browsers you need. For example, to install only Chromium:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml
name: Playwright tests

jobs:
  playwright-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Other steps...

      - name: Install Playwright dependencies
        run: npm exec -- playwright install --with-deps chromium

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npm exec -- playwright test
```

### Cache browsers installation

Caching dependencies is tricky since they are system-installed, but browsers are installed in `~/.cache/ms-playwright`, making them cacheable.

Create a composite action to set up Playwright and cache browsers:

```yaml
# .github/actions/setup-playwright/action.yml
name: Setup Playwright
description: Install Playwright and dependencies
runs:
  using: "composite"
  steps:
    # Run npm ci and get Playwright version
    - name: üèó Prepare Playwright env
      shell: bash
      run: |
        PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION=$(npm ls --json @playwright/test | jq --raw-output '.dependencies["@playwright/test"].version')
        echo "PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION=$PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION" >> $GITHUB_ENV

    # Cache browser binaries, cache key is based on Playwright version and OS
    - name: üß∞ Cache Playwright browser binaries
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      id: playwright-cache
      with:
        path: "~/.cache/ms-playwright"
        key: "${{ runner.os }}-playwright-${{ env.PLAYWRIGHT_VERSION }}"
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-playwright-

    # Install browser binaries & OS dependencies if cache missed
    - name: üèó Install Playwright browser binaries & OS dependencies
      if: steps.playwright-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
      shell: bash
      run: |
        npm exec -- playwright install --with-deps chromium

    # Install only the OS dependencies if cache hit
    - name: üèó Install Playwright OS dependencies
      if: steps.playwright-cache.outputs.cache-hit == 'true'
      shell: bash
      run: |
        npm exec -- playwright install-deps chromium
```

Update your workflow to use the composite action:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml
name: Playwright tests

jobs:
  playwright-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Other steps...

      - name: Setup Playwright
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup-playwright

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npm exec -- playwright test
```

## Run tests in parallel

By default, tests in a spec are not run in parallel, which can slow down the overall test execution time. To optimize, enable parallel test execution by setting `fullyParallel: true` in your Playwright configuration.

### Enabling full parallelism

Add the following to your Playwright configuration file:

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  fullyParallel: true,
  // Other configurations...
});
```

### Controlling parallel mode by spec

You can control the parallel execution mode for individual test suites using `test.describe.configure`. This allows for more granular control over which tests should run in parallel:

```ts
// example.spec.ts
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe.configure({ mode: "parallel" });

test.describe("My test suite", () => {
  test("Test 1", async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation...
  });

  test("Test 2", async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation...
  });
});
```

For more details on parallel test execution, refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel).

If you want to know every tricks about Playwright, I recommend the courses from [Bondar Academy](https://www.bondaracademy.com/) especially the [Master test automation with Playwright course](https://www.bondaracademy.com/course/sdet-with-playwright) that includes the setup of Argos.

## Conclusion

Setting up Playwright can be time-consuming on CI, especially if you shard your tests. By using these techniques, you can save significant setup time, enhancing your team's productivity. Enabling parallel test execution can further speed up your tests, making your CI pipelines even more efficient.
