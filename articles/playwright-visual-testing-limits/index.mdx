This isn't just slow. It breaks your flow.

And this isn't a tooling problem. It's a model problem.

## Why local visual testing breaks down in a team

- You have to run the full test suite locally just to regenerate screenshots before pushing
- You're comparing against screenshots you pulled which may already be outdated
- Screenshots live in Git, polluting diffs and causing merge conflicts
- Tests are flaky due to environment inconsistencies (OS, browser, rendering)
- Reviewing visual diffs is hard when you're limited to raw image diffs

## Bootstrap a solution? A misguided approach

It's technically possible to run visual testing with Playwright in CI. You can use GitHub Actions and the artifacts system to store and compare screenshots automatically. Here is a [full guide that explains how](https://medium.com/@mikestopcontinues/how-to-run-snapshot-tests-in-ci-cd-with-playwright-7f78ff6ae4e8).

It includes maintaining custom scripts, juggling artifact storage, reverse-engineering Git history to find the right baseline, and constantly debugging flaky tests from subtle rendering differences.

The result is a fragile, time-consuming setup with no built-in UI to review visual changes. It works, but it's far from ergonomic or team-friendly.

## A different approach: generate in CI, compare to production

A scalable visual testing workflow needs to flip the model.

Instead of running tests locally and storing screenshots in Git, what if:

- Screenshots were generated automatically in CI
- Comparisons are always made against the actual state of your production
- No one had to commit images manually
- Reviews in a dedicated UI where you can inspect visual diffs, accept or reject them, and track changes history

This is the model [Argos](https://argos-ci.com) follows.

You push your branch. Screenshots are captured automatically in CI.
They're compared to the single source of truth: `main`.
You get a visual diff. No manual test runs, no image files in Git, no guesswork.

You review the changes in the UI. If they look correct, you click “Accept” and done!

## Visual reviews that fit into your workflow

Argos integrates tightly with GitHub and GitLab. Visual diffs are posted as comments with status checks directly in your pull requests.

![Green Argos check status](/assets/articles/playwright-visual-testing-limits/green-argos-check-status.png)

You can:

- See what changed in every pull request
- Accept changes with a single click
- View the history of a given page or component's appearance across time

You review inline, with full context, and move on without pushing updated screenshots or rerunning tests.

## Less noise, more trust

Argos also tackles another major pain point: stability.

Because screenshots are captured in a controlled CI environment, and processed with Argos' own stabilization algorithm:

- You benefit from **consistent comparisons** across all environments
- You see fewer diffs, and the ones you do see are meaningful
- Your workflow becomes streamlined, allowing you to focus on shipping features

Stabilizing visual tests with custom Playwright scripts is a never-ending task.
At Argos, we've built a dedicated stabilization algorithm based on years of studying why visual tests fail.
It automatically handles animation disabling, font loading, image normalization, and many subtle sources of **false diffs**, so you don't have to.

You can **trust the output**.
You don't need to double-check every time.

## Setting it up Argos with Playwright takes 5 minutes

Integrating [Argos into a Playwright](/docs/playwright) project is straightforward.
Basically, replace `toHaveScreenshot` with `argosScreenshot` in your tests.

```ts
// example.spec.ts
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/playwright";
import { test } from "@playwright/test";

test("example test", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("https://playwright.dev");
  await argosScreenshot(page, "homepage");
});
```

And, update your `playwright.config.ts` file to upload screenshots to Argos at the end of the test run.

```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@playwright/test";

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    // Use "dot" reporter on CI, "list" otherwise (Playwright default).
    process.env.CI ? ["dot"] : ["list"],
    // Add Argos reporter. Upload on CI only.
    ["@argos-ci/playwright/reporter", { uploadToArgos: !!process.env.CI }],
  ],

  // Setup test debugging on CI.
  use: {
    trace: "on-first-retry",
    screenshot: "only-on-failure",
  },
});
```

## Conclusion: This isn't a plugin. It's a different model.

`toMatchSnapshot` isn't broken.
It's just not designed for projects that scale: for teams, CI, or long-lived codebases with multiple contributors.

At some point, what was once a convenience becomes a bottleneck.
The visual testing tool becomes the thing slowing you down.

When that happens, the right move isn't to stop testing visuals.
It's to adopt a model that fits the way your team actually works.
