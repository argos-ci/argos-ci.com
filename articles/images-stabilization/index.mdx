Recently, we tackled an issue with image instability in Argos that led to false positives in visual regression tests. This article walks you through our discovery process, analysis, and the solution we implemented.

## Identifying the problem

At Argos, we continuously interact with our customers. One recurring complaint was that captured images were inconsistent, causing unreliable visual regression results. While differences in browser rendering engines can explain some variations, customers reported instability even on the same browser and operating system.

We dug deeper to understand why images were unstable despite the deterministic nature of computer programs. Our investigation revealed that the problem often occurred when using the [viewports feature](https://argos-ci.com/docs/viewports) for capturing images on different screen sizes.

## Analysis

We discovered that when the viewport size changed, some images were not resized correctly. For example, one image might measure `288x359.81`, while another measures `288x359.64`.

These slight differences stem from a changing aspect ratio when the browser window is resized. Consider these two scenarios:

- On resize:
  Aspect ratio is 1536:1919, leading to a computed height of
  288 \* 1919 / 1536 = 359.8125
- On initial load:
  Aspect ratio is 800:999, leading to a computed height of
  288 \* 999 / 800 = 359.64

Additionally, the images differ in resolution: the first is high-resolution (1536x1919 for 2.4MB) and the second is low-resolution (800x999 for 1.1MB). The culprit here is the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes in the `<img>` tag.

## The role of srcset and sizes

The `srcset` attribute lets you specify different image sources for varying screen sizes. The browser uses the `sizes` attribute to determine which image to load.

For instance:

```html
<img
  src="image.jpg"
  srcset="image-800.jpg 800w, image-1536.jpg 1536w"
  sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"
  alt="A beautiful image"
/>
```

If the viewport is below 800px, the browser loads `image-800.jpg`. Above that, it loads `image-1536.jpg`. To optimize performance during resizing, browsers often reuse high-resolution images from cache, which can cause visual discrepancies.

## Our solution: forcing a re-evaluation of srcset

We needed a method to force the browser to reload the image when the viewport is resized. A naive approach might be to reset the srcset attribute; however, browsers don’t re-evaluate it unless a reflow is triggered.

### Code to force the reload

```ts
const forceReload = (img: HTMLImageElement) => {
  const srcset = img.getAttribute("srcset");
  img.setAttribute("srcset", "");
  // Force reflow
  void img.offsetWidth;
  img.setAttribute("srcset", srcset);
};
```

By resetting srcset, [triggering a reflow](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/5d52fb081b3570c81e3a) (using `offsetWidth`), and restoring the original value, we force the browser to re-evaluate which image to load.

### Listening for resize events

We then detect viewport changes using the `resize` event:

```ts
const onResize = () => {
  const images = document.querySelectorAll("img[srcset]");
  images.forEach((img) => {
    forceReload(img as HTMLImageElement);
  });
};

window.addEventListener("resize", onResize);
```

This ensures every image with a `srcset` is reloaded appropriately upon window resize.

## Integrating with Playwright

When running tests in Playwright, simply reloading images isn’t enough. Since the browser takes a screenshot before the new image loads, we must wait for the images to complete loading:

```ts
// Reload srcset on resize
await page.evaluate(() => {
  const forceReload = (img: HTMLImageElement) => {
    const srcset = img.getAttribute("srcset");
    img.setAttribute("srcset", "");
    void img.offsetWidth;
    img.setAttribute("srcset", srcset);
  };

  const onResize = () => {
    const images = document.querySelectorAll("img[srcset]");
    images.forEach((img) => {
      forceReload(img as HTMLImageElement);
    });
  };

  window.addEventListener("resize", onResize);
});

// Resize the viewport
await page.setViewportSize({ width: 800, height: 600 });

// Wait for all images to load
await page.waitForFunction(() =>
  Array.from(document.images).every((img) => img.complete),
);

// Take a screenshot
await page.screenshot({ path: "screenshot.png" });
```

This approach guarantees that screenshots capture the correctly reloaded images.

## Stabilization in Argos

While image instability is one issue, visual testing can also be disrupted by:

- Fonts not loading
- Visible loaders
- Unwanted spellcheck markers

Argos addresses these with a stabilization algorithm. This system auto-detects such issues and applies fixes, ensuring consistent results across testing engines like Cypress, Playwright, Puppeteer, and WebdriverIO.

### Plugin for image stabilization

To encapsulate the image stabilization, we implemented a plugin:

```ts
import type { Plugin } from "..";

/**
 * Force the reload of srcset on resize.
 * To ensure that if the viewport changes, it's the same behaviour
 * as if the page was reloaded.
 */
export const plugin: Plugin = {
  name: "image-srcset",
  beforeAll() {
    const handleResize = () => {
      Array.from(document.images).forEach((img) => {
        const srcset = img.getAttribute("srcset");
        if (srcset) {
          img.setAttribute("srcset", "");
          // Force reflow
          void img.offsetWidth;
          img.setAttribute("srcset", srcset);
        }
      });
    };

    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
    };
  },
};
```

This plugin adds a resize event listener before tests run and cleans it up afterward to prevent memory leaks.

## Conclusion

Visual testing should be rock-solid, not a guessing game. Argos brings determinism to the chaos by eliminating flakiness at the source: unstable images, layout shifts, flickering fonts, and even sneaky spellcheck artifacts. Our stabilization engine rewrites the rules with deep viewport awareness and precise control over srcset behavior, delivering unmatched reliability across browsers and test runners.

Skip the false positives, ship with confidence, and let Argos handle the visual noise.
