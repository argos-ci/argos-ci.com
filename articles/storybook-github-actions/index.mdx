Visual regression testing is crucial for maintaining UI consistency. **Argos** automates this by comparing screenshots over time, catching visual changes early. By integrating Argos with [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/) and **GitHub Actions**, you can run visual regression tests directly within your CI/CD pipeline, catching issues early in development.

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough to integrate Argos with Storybook and GitHub Actions, ensuring any visual inconsistencies are caught during development.

## Overview

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
- [Setting Up Argos](#setting-up-argos)
- [Configuring Storybook for Visual Testing](#configuring-storybook-for-visual-testing)
- [Automating with GitHub Actions](#automating-with-github-actions)
- [Conclusion](#conclusion)

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, make sure you have:

- A GitHub repository with **Storybook** already installed and configured.
- Basic knowledge of GitHub Actions and experience with CI/CD workflows.

## Setting Up Argos

Follow these steps to configure Argos for your project:

### 1. Create an Argos Account

- Sign up at [argos-ci.com](https://argos-ci.com/) using your GitHub account.
- Authorize Argos to access your repositories.

### 2. Add Your Repository

- In the Argos dashboard, click on **Add a repository**.
- Select the GitHub repository you want to integrate.
- Follow the setup instructions on the screen to complete the configuration.

### 3. Copy the Argos Token

- Go to the settings page for your repository on Argos.
- Copy the **ARGOS_TOKEN**; you’ll need it for your GitHub Actions configuration.

## Configuring Storybook for Visual Testing

To capture screenshots, we’ll use the **Storybook Test Runner** and Argos SDK.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Add the necessary dependencies for the Storybook test runner and Argos SDK:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @argos-ci/cli @argos-ci/storybook @storybook/test-runner
```

### 2. Update `package.json` Scripts

In your `package.json`, add scripts to build Storybook, run tests, and upload screenshots:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build-storybook": "build-storybook",
    "test-storybook": "NODE_NO_WARNINGS=1 NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules test-storybook",
    "upload-screenshots": "npm exec argos -- upload screenshots --build-name storybook"
  }
}
```

- The `test-storybook` script uses Storybook’s test runner to execute tests and capture screenshots.
- The `upload-screenshots` script uploads the screenshots to Argos for visual comparison.

**Note:** `NODE_OPTIONS=--experimental-vm-modules` is required due to Storybook’s reliance on Jest, which needs this flag to run modern packages like Argos Storybook SDK.

### 3. Add a `.storybook/test-runner.ts` File

Create a `test-runner.ts` file in your `.storybook` directory to configure screenshot capture:

```ts
// .storybook/test-runner.ts
import { argosScreenshot } from "@argos-ci/storybook";
import type { TestRunnerConfig } from "@storybook/test-runner";

const config: TestRunnerConfig = {
  async postVisit(page, context) {
    await argosScreenshot(page, context);
  },
};

export default config;
```

This configuration will capture screenshots of your stories in the `./screenshots` directory. Be sure to add this directory to `.gitignore`.

### 4. Run Storybook Test Runner Locally

Run the Storybook test runner locally to verify screenshots are generated correctly:

```bash
npx test-storybook
```

This command will capture screenshots of your stories and save them to `./screenshots`.

## Automating with GitHub Actions

Next, we’ll set up GitHub Actions to automate visual regression testing. This example runs against a locally served Storybook instance.

### 1. Add ARGOS_TOKEN to GitHub Secrets

- In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
- Click on **New repository secret**.
- Add a secret named `ARGOS_TOKEN` and paste in the token from Argos.

### 2. Create the GitHub Actions Workflow

Add the following workflow file to `.github/workflows/storybook-tests.yml`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/storybook-tests.yml

name: "Storybook Tests"
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: ".nvmrc"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Build Storybook
        run: npm run build-storybook -- --quiet
      - name: Serve Storybook and Run Tests
        run: |
          npx concurrently -k -s first -n "SB,TEST" -c "magenta,blue" \
            "npx http-server storybook-static --port 6006 --silent" \
            "npx wait-on tcp:127.0.0.1:6006 && npm run test-storybook && npm run upload-screenshots"
        env:
          ARGOS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ARGOS_TOKEN }}
```

**Note:** Storybook outputs the build to `storybook-static` by default. If using a different output directory, adjust accordingly.

This workflow triggers on every push to `main` and on pull requests. It will build Storybook, serve it locally, run the tests, and upload screenshots to Argos.

## Conclusion

By integrating Argos with Storybook and GitHub Actions, you now have a reliable automated visual regression testing setup. This process helps you catch visual inconsistencies early, ensuring UI stability and quality.
