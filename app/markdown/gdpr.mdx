## What is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data privacy law from the European Union. It's been in effect since May 25, 2018, and applies to any business processing personal data from EU residents.

GDPR grants individuals several important rights:

- The right to know how their data is used
- The right to access and correct their data
- The right to delete their data
- The right to limit or object to processing
- The right to data portability
- Protection from decisions made solely by automated systems

## Why it matters

Many of our customers are based in Europe or serve European users. Meeting GDPR requirements is not only a legal responsibility â€” it's part of earning and maintaining your trust.

## What we do

We've aligned our operations with GDPR, from the way we handle data to how we design our systems.

## Data location

Argos stores data in the United States. To ensure lawful transfers from the EU, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses and other required safeguards.

## How we protect your data

We apply modern security practices to protect personally identifiable information (PII), including:

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Strict access control policies
- Real-time monitoring

## Acting as your processor

When we process data on behalf of our customers, we do so in accordance with GDPR Article 28. Our [Terms of Service](/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy) explain our commitments in detail.
