## What is SOC 2?

SOC 2 is a security framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).

It assesses how organizations manage customer data across five trust service principles: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.

There are two types of SOC 2 reports:

- **Type I**: Verifies that controls are properly designed at a specific point in time.
- **Type II**: Evaluates how effectively those controls operate over a defined period.

**Argos is certified for SOC 2 Type II.**

## Why it matters

While not legally required, SOC 2 certification demonstrates our commitment to strong security practices and accountability.

It reflects our long-term dedication to protecting customer data and maintaining trust.
