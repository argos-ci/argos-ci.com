# Security Policy

We prioritize the security of Argos and are committed to protecting our users' data by following industry best practices. For comprehensive details, please refer to our [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/blob/main/SECURITY.md) file. Additionally, visit our [GitHub Security page](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/security) for information on vulnerability management and security advisories.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately by emailing us at [security@argos-ci.com](mailto:security@argos-ci.com). We will work with you to assess and address the issue promptly.

### Reporting Guidelines

- Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.
- We aim to acknowledge your report within 2 business days.
- You will receive updates as we investigate and resolve the vulnerability.

## Security Updates

We regularly review our codebase for potential security issues and promptly release updates. Stay informed by watching this repository for releases and updates.

## Product Security

### Authentication

We rely on trusted social login providers like GitHub and Google to authenticate users. No passwords or sensitive information are stored by Argos.

### Permissions

Argos allows you to set permission levels within the app for your team members. Permissions can control access to app settings, billing, and critical activities.

### Uptime

We maintain an uptime of 99.8% or higher. Our status page is available at [argos.openstatus.dev](https://argos.openstatus.dev).

## Network and Application Security

### Data Hosting and Storage

Argos services and data are hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) facilities located in the USA (us-east-1) and Europe (eu-west-1).

### Backups and Monitoring

We perform periodic backups of customer data and service metadata to ensure reliable recovery if needed.

### Permissions and Authentication

Access to customer data is restricted to authorized employees who require it for their work. Argos is served 100% over HTTPS. We enforce 2-factor authentication (2FA) and strong password policies on our services to protect access to third-party services.

### Encryption

All data sent to or from Argos is encrypted in transit using 256-bit encryption. Our API and application endpoints are TLS/SSL only.

### Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Scanning

We use third-party security tools to periodically scan for vulnerabilities in our application and network layers, including [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) and GitHub's Dependabot.

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We encourage security researchers to report any vulnerabilities they find. For more details, see our [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/argos-ci/argos/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

### Rules of Engagement

Security researchers must not:

- Disclose vulnerability information except as outlined in this policy.
- Engage in social engineering or phishing against Argos users.
- Execute or attempt to execute Denial of Service (DoS) or Resource Exhaustion attacks.
- Introduce malicious software.
- Test in ways that could degrade the operation of Argos systems.
- Test third-party applications, websites, or services that integrate with Argos.
- Alter, delete, or exfiltrate Argos data.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

We accept vulnerability reports at [security@argos-ci.com](mailto:security@argos-ci.com). Reports may be submitted anonymously.

Your information will be used for defensive purposes only, to mitigate or remediate vulnerabilities. If your findings include newly discovered vulnerabilities affecting others beyond Argos, we may share your report with relevant organizations under a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process. We will not share your name or contact information without your permission.

When submitting a report, please:

- Describe the vulnerability, where it was discovered, and the potential impact.
- Provide detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept scripts or screenshots are helpful).

### Disclosure

Argos is committed to timely correction of vulnerabilities. To reduce risk, we ask that you refrain from sharing information about discovered vulnerabilities for 90 calendar days after we acknowledge receipt of your report. If you believe others should be informed sooner, please coordinate with us in advance.

### Contact

If you have any questions or comments about this policy, please contact us at [contact@argos-ci.com](mailto:contact@argos-ci.com). We will make every effort to respond within a reasonable timeframe.
