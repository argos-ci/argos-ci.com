        <p>
          Flaky tests are a significant issue in visual testing, and each
          product has its own way of addressing this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Percy</strong> re-render <strong>snapshots</strong> of your
          code on their servers, then compare the diffs. This approach can cause
          flaky tests that are hard to debug, especially with complex JavaScript
          renders.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Argos</strong> provides several integration to capture stable{" "}
          <strong>screenshots</strong> locally. If one of them is unstable, you
          can easily refine your tests to avoid false positives.
